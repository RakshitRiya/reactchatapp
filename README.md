# reactchatapp

You can use this app live at: https://roomchatappreact.netlify.com/ .
Ask your friend/friends to use the same room name and enter the room to chat. No database has been used, therefore, there's complete privacy of 
the user. None of your messages would be stored.
Also thanks to https://github.com/adrianhajdin/project_chat_application for the original project.
